# Locally Weighted Regressions
* In regression problems there is a continuous output(dependent) variable that we try to predict it's value within a range of input features.
* There is noise( $ϵ$ ) which means for esentially the same input there can be slightly different values for the output.
* The assumption is that noise follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and an unknown standard distribution.
* A simple representation is $y=f(X)+σϵ$
* For linear regression, the prediction is a weighted combination of input features.
*Predicted Value = $weight_1 *$ Feature $_1 + weight_2 *$ Feature $_2 +$ etc...
